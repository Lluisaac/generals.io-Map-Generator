# generals.io Map Generator
A map generator for the rts game [general.io](http://generals.io).

In this game, there is a random generator that makes maps on which you play against other players. This generator is oftentimes unfair and a source of a lot of frustration for me. This is my attempt at making a better generator.

## Getting Started

To launch using eclipse, first add all jars in "/lib" in the Java Build Path Libraries. You also have to add the argument "-Djava.library.path=lib/natives" to the run configuration.
